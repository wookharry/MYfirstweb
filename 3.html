<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/ ⓘ), often abbreviated as JS, 
    is a programming language and core technology of the World
     Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of we
     bsites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior
     .[10]
Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that 
executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in
 some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime 
 system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language
 that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typi
 ng, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. I
 t is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
  programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for wo
  rking with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and t
  he Document Object Model (DOM).
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as ne
tworking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web
browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax,
 the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
